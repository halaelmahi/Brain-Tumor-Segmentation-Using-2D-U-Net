# Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-Using-2D-U-Net
Implemented a 2D U-Net for brain tumor segmentation on MRI using the BraTS dataset. Preprocessed multimodal inputs (T1, T1ce, T2, FLAIR) and trained with Dice loss, achieving a mean Dice of 0.85. The project impressed my professor for its precision, clarity, and clinical relevance in automating tumor delineation.
